# DSA Notes and Concepts

Welcome to my collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) notes. This repository is structured to provide quick, easy-to-understand reference material for revising concepts and solving coding problems efficiently.

## 🗂️ Table of Contents

### 1. Core Concepts (Root)
* [**Bitwise Operations**](Bitwise_Operations.md)
  Contains common tricks and techniques for manipulating individual bits in integers (e.g., checking powers of 2, isolating bits).
* [**GCC Built-in Functions**](Builtin_Functions.md)
  A reference for highly optimized GCC compiler built-ins (like counting set bits, leading zeros, parity checks).
* [**Strings and Numbers**](Strings_and_Numbers.md)
  Quick guides for converting between strings, integers, and handling character traits (like `isalpha`, `isdigit`).

### 2. Standard Template Library (`STL/`)
* [**Array Manipulation**](STL/Array_Manipulation.md)
  Vector operations, reversing, filling (`iota`), finding unique elements, and next permutations.
* [**Math and Number Theory**](STL/Math_and_Number_Theory.md)
  Arithmetic operations, GCD/LCM, and rounding utilities (`ceil`, `floor`, `round`).
* [**Searching and Sorting**](STL/Searching_and_Sorting.md)
  Binary search, bounds (`lower_bound`, `upper_bound`), and stable sorting algorithms.

### 3. Patterns & Observations (`patterns_that_i_notices/`)
* [**Cube Roots**](patterns_that_i_notices/cube_roots.md)
  _Note: This section contains specific math patterns and observations around cube roots noticed during problem-solving._
